  abstract =      {Microarrays can measure the expression of thousands
                   of genes to identify changes in expression between
                   different biological states. Methods are needed to
                   determine the significance of these changes while
                   accounting for the enormous number of genes. We
                   describe a method, Significance Analysis of
                   Microarrays (SAM), that assigns a score to each gene
                   on the basis of change in gene expression relative to
                   the standard deviation of repeated measurements. For
                   genes with scores greater than an adjustable
                   threshold, SAM uses permutations of the repeated
                   measurements to estimate the percentage of genes
                   identified by chance, the false discovery rate (FDR).
                   When the transcriptional response of human cells to
                   ionizing radiation was measured by microarrays, SAM
                   identified 34 genes that changed at least 1.5-fold
                   with an estimated FDR of 12\%, compared with FDRs of
                   60 and 84\% by using conventional methods of
                   analysis. Of the 34 genes, 19 were involved in cell
                   cycle regulation and 3 in apoptosis. Surprisingly,
                   four nucleotide excision repair genes were induced,
                   suggesting that this repair pathway for UV-damaged
                   DNA might play a previously unrecognized role in
                   repairing DNA damaged by ionizing radiation.},

  abstract =      {There are many methods of correcting microarray data
                   for non-biological sources of error. Authors
                   routinely supply software or code so that interested
                   analysts can implement their methods. Even with a
                   thorough reading of associated references, it is not
                   always clear how requisite parts of the method are
                   calculated in the software packages. However, it is
                   important to have an understanding of such details,
                   as this understanding is necessary for proper use of
                   the output, or for implementing extensions to the
                   model. In this paper, the calculation of parameter
                   estimates used in Robust Multichip Average (RMA), a
                   popular preprocessing algorithm for Affymetrix
                   GeneChip brand microarrays, is elucidated. The
                   background correction method for RMA assumes that the
                   perfect match (PM) intensities observed result from a
                   convolution of the true signal, assumed to be
                   exponentially distributed, and a background noise
                   component, assumed to have a normal distribution. A
                   conditional expectation is calculated to estimate
                   signal. Estimates of the mean and variance of the
                   normal distribution and the rate parameter of the
                   exponential distribution are needed to calculate this
                   expectation. Simulation studies show that the current
                   estimates are flawed; therefore, new ones are
                   suggested. We examine the performance of
                   preprocessing under the exponential-normal
                   convolution model using several different methods to
                   estimate the parameters.},

                   multiple high density oligonucleotide arrays, it is
                   important to remove sources of variation between
                   arrays of non-biological origin. Normalization is a
                   process for reducing this variation. It is common to
                   see non-linear relations between arrays and the
                   standard normalization provided by Affymetrix does
                   not perform well in these situations. Results: We
                   present three methods of performing normalization at
                   the probe intensity level. These methods are called
                   complete data methods because they make use of data
                   from all arrays in an experiment to form the
                   normalizing relation. These algorithms are compared
                   to two methods that make use of a baseline array: a
                   one number scaling based algorithm and a method that
                   uses a non-linear normalizing relation by comparing
                   the variability and bias of an expression measure.
                   Two publicly available datasets are used to carry out
                   the comparisons. The simplest and quickest complete
                   data method is found to perform favorably.
                   Availability: Software implementing all three of the

                   associated to a young stellar object, and a spiral
                   galaxy. We observe large variations of the spectral
                   index (from 0.8 to 2.4) in a wide range of
                   temperatures (11 to 80 K). These spectral index
                   variations follow a hyperbolic-shaped function of the
                   temperature, high spectral indices (1.6-2.4) being
                   observed in cold regions (11-20 K) while low indices
                   (0.8-1.6) are observed in warm regions (35-80 K).
                   Three distinct effects may play a role in this
                   temperature dependence: one is that the grain sizes
                   change in dense environments, another is that the
                   chemical composition of the grains is not the same in
                   different environments, a third one is that there is
                   an intrinsic dependence of the dust spectral index on
                   the temperature due to quantum processes. This last
                   effect is backed up by laboratory measurements and
                   could be the dominant one.},

  volume =        {481},
  year =          {2008},
  abstract =      {Aims: Archeops is a balloon-borne experiment, mainly
                   designed to measure the Cosmic Microwave Background
                   (CMB) temperature anisotropies at high angular
                   resolution (\~{}12 arcmin). By-products of the
                   mission are shallow sensitivity maps over a large
                   fraction of the sky (about 30\%) in the millimetre
                   and submillimetre range at 143, 217, 353 and 545 GHz.
                   From these maps, we produce a catalog of bright
                   submillimetre point sources. Methods: We present in
                   this paper the processing and analysis of the
                   Archeops point sources. Redundancy across detectors
                   is the key factor allowing us to distinguish glitches
                   from genuine point sources in the 20 independent
                   maps. Results: We look at the properties of the most
                   reliable point sources, totalling 304. Fluxes range
                   from 1 to 10 000 Jy (at the frequencies covering 143
                   to 545 GHz). All sources are either planets (2) or of
                   galactic origin. The longitude range is from 75 to
                   198 degrees. Some of the sources are associated with
                   the well-known Lynds Nebulae and HII compact regions
                   in the galactic plane. A large fraction of the
                   sources have an IRAS counterpart. Except for Jupiter,
                   Saturn, the Crab and Cas A, all sources show a
                   dust-emission-like modified blackbody emission
                   spectrum. Temperatures cover a range from 7 to 27 K.
                   For the coldest sources (T \&lt; 10 K), a steep $\nu$
                   $\beta$ emissivity law is found with a surprising
                   $\beta$ \~{} 3 to 4. An inverse relationship between
                   T and $\beta$ is observed. The number density of
                   sources at 353 GHz with flux brighter than 100 Jy is
                   of the order of 1 per degree of Galactic longitude.
                   These sources will provide a strong check for the
                   calibration of the Planck HFI focal plane geometry as
                   a complement to planets. These very cold sources
                   observed by Archeops should be prime targets for
                   mapping observations by the Akari and Herschel space
                   missions and ground-based observatories. Tables 3 and

  abstract =      {Context. RCW 120 is a well-studied, nearby Galactic H
                   ii region with ongoing star formation in its
                   surroundings. Previous work has shown that it
                   displays a bubble morphology at mid-infrared
                   wavelengths, and has a massive layer of collected
                   neutral material seen at sub-mm wavelengths. Given
                   the well-defined photo-dissociation region (PDR)
                   boundary and collected layer, it is an excellent
                   laboratory to study the “collect and collapse”
                   process of triggered star formation. Using Herschel
                   Space Observatory data at 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500
                   $\mu$m, in combination with Spitzer and APEX-LABOCA
                   data, we can for the first time map the entire
                   spectral energy distribution of an H ii region at
                   high angular resolution. Aims: We seek a better
                   understanding of RCW 120 and its local environment by
                   analysing its dust temperature distribution.
                   Additionally, we wish to understand how the dust
                   emissivity index, $\beta$, is related to the dust
                   temperature. Methods: We determine dust temperatures
                   in selected regions of the RCW 120 field by fitting
                   their spectral energy distribution (SED), derived
                   using aperture photometry. Additionally, we fit the
                   SED extracted from a grid of positions to create a
                   temperature map. Results: We find a gradient in dust
                   temperature, ranging from ⪆30 K in the interior of
                   RCW 120, to \~{}20 K for the material collected in
                   the PDR, to \~{}10 K toward local infrared dark
                   clouds and cold filaments. There is an additional,
                   hotter (\~{}100 K) component to the dust emission
                   that we do not investigate here. Our results suggest
                   that RCW 120 is in the process of destroying the PDR
                   delineating its bubble morphology. The leaked
                   radiation from its interior may influence the
                   creation of the next generation of stars. We find
                   support for an anti-correlation between the fitted
                   temperature and $\beta$, in rough agreement with what
                   has been found previously. The extended wavelength
                   coverage of the Herschel data greatly increases the
                   reliability of this result. Herschel is an ESA space

                   critical for gas mass determinations derived from
                   far-infrared observations, but also for separating
                   dust foreground emission from the Cosmic Microwave
                   Background (CMB). Hi-GAL observations allow us for
                   the first time to study the dust emissivity
                   variations in the inner regions of the Galactic plane
                   at resolution below 1°. Aims: We present maps of the
                   emissivity spectral index derived from the combined
                   Herschel PACS 160 $\mu$m, SPIRE 250 $\mu$m, 350
                   $\mu$m, and 500 $\mu$m data, and the IRIS 100 $\mu$m
                   data, and we analyze the spatial variations of the

                   wavelength in the two science demonstration phase
                   Hi-GAL fields, centered at l = 30° and l = 59°.
                   Methods: Applying two different methods, we determine
                   both dust temperature and emissivity spectral index
                   between 100 and 500 $\mu$m, at an angular resolution
                   ($\theta$) of 4'. Results: Combining both fields, the
                   results show variations of the emissivity spectral
                   index in the range 1.8-2.6 for temperatures between
                   14 and 23 K. The median values of the spectral index
                   are similar in both fields, i.e. 2.3 in the range
                   100-500 $\mu$m, while the median dust temperatures
                   are equal to 19.1 K and 16.0 K in the l = 30° and l
                   = 59° field, respectively. Statistically, we do not
                   see any significant deviations in the spectra from a
                   power law emissivity between 100 and 500 $\mu$m. We
                   confirm the existence of an inverse correlation
                   between the emissivity spectral index and dust

                   temperature variations and noise on two commonly used
                   methods to determine dust properties from
                   dust-continuum observations of dense cores. One
                   method employs a direct fit to a modified blackbody
                   spectral energy distribution (SED); the other
                   involves a comparison of flux ratios to an analytical
                   prediction. Fitting fluxes near the SED peak produces
                   inaccurate temperature and dust spectral index
                   estimates due to the line-of-sight temperature (and
                   density) variations. Longer wavelength fluxes in the
                   Rayleigh-Jeans part of the spectrum (gsim 600 $\mu$m
                   for typical cores) may more accurately recover the
                   spectral index, but both methods are very sensitive
                   to noise. The temperature estimate approaches the
                   density-weighted temperature, or "column
                   temperature," of the source as short wavelength
                   fluxes are excluded. An inverse temperature-spectral
                   index correlation naturally results from SED fitting,
                   due to the inaccurate isothermal assumption, as well
                   as noise uncertainties. We show that above some
                   "threshold" temperature, the temperatures estimated
                   through the flux ratio method can be highly
                   inaccurate. In general, observations with widely
                   separated wavelengths, and including shorter
                   wavelengths, result in higher threshold temperatures;
                   such observations thus allow for more accurate
                   temperature estimates of sources with temperatures
                   less than the threshold temperature. When only three
                   fluxes are available, a constrained fit, where the
                   spectral index is fixed, produces less scatter in the
                   temperature estimate when compared to the estimate
                   from the flux ratio method.},

  abstract =      {Various studies have shown that cancer tissue samples
                   can be successfully detected and classified by their
                   gene expression patterns using machine learning
                   approaches. One of the challenges in applying these
                   techniques for classifying gene expression data is to
                   extract accurate, readily interpretable rules
                   providing biological insight as to how classification
                   is performed. Current methods generate classifiers
                   that are accurate but difficult to interpret. This is
                   the trade-off between credibility and
                   comprehensibility of the classifiers. Here, we
                   introduce a new classifier in order to address these
                   problems. It is referred to as k-TSP (k-Top Scoring
                   Pairs) and is based on the concept of 'relative
                   expression reversals'. This method generates simple
                   and accurate decision rules that only involve a small
                   number of gene-to-gene expression comparisons,
                   thereby facilitating follow-up studies.},

  abstract =      {Since their popularization in the 1990s, Markov chain
                   Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have revolutionized
                   statistical computing and have had an especially
                   profound impact on the practice of Bayesian
                   statistics. Furthermore, MCMC methods have enabled
                   the development and use of intricate models in an
                   astonishing array of disciplines as diverse as
                   fisheries science and economics. The wide-ranging
                   practical importance of MCMC has sparked an expansive
                   and deep investigation into fundamental Markov chain
                   theory. The Handbook of Markov Chain Monte Carlo
                   provides a reference for the broad audience of
                   developers and users of MCMC methodology interested
                   in keeping up with cutting-edge theory and
                   applications. The first half of the book covers MCMC
                   foundations, methodology, and algorithms. The second
                   half considers the use of MCMC in a variety of
                   practical applications including in educational
                   research, astrophysics, brain imaging, ecology, and
                   sociology. The in-depth introductory section of the
                   book allows graduate students and practicing
                   scientists new to MCMC to become thoroughly
                   acquainted with the basic theory, algorithms, and
                   applications. The book supplies detailed examples and
                   case studies of realistic scientific problems
                   presenting the diversity of methods used by the
                   wide-ranging MCMC community. Those familiar with MCMC

     abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},
